## Routing

We use [`next-typesafe-url`](https://next-typesafe-url.dev/) for type-safe routing to prevent broken links by enforcing valid route structures. All child routes of `[locale]` extend the validation schema set there.

> Note: TypeScript's autosuggestion may occasionally fail to suggest all generated URLs. In such cases, paths can be typed manually and will still be type-checked.

## URL Generation

The `$path` helper should be used for all imperative links. For example:

<Dropzone />

```typescript
type T = {
  test: string;
};
```

This approach gives you the full power of React components within your markdown content!
