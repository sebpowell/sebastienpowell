For a recent project, I needed to create a dropzone component with an inset dashed border.

I thought it would look cool if the border animated on hover.

The design required precise control over the dash pattern, but the CSS `border` property offers limited flexibility. You can make it dashed and adjust its width, but you can't define the dash array.

I tried a `linear-gradient` trick ([like this one](https://codepen.io/amit_sheen/pen/xxZeyjO)), but it doesnâ€™t play nicely with `border-radius`.

In the end, I used an SVG, which gives full control over both the dash pattern and corner radius. [This generator](https://kovart.github.io/dashed-border-generator/) came in handy when testing.

The SVG is absolutely positioned as an overlay to fill the parent component. The animation runs only on hover, applied programmatically since `pointer-events: none` keeps the SVG from blocking interaction with underlying elements.

Here is the final result:
