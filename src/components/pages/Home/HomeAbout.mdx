I'm a designer and engineer, based in sunny Norfolk, England. Over the past decade, I've helped take multiple products from 0–1 – as a co-founder ([GetAgent.co.uk](https://getagent.co.uk/), [Making Jam](https://www.makingjam.io/), [LeadPro](https://lead.pro/) – exited in 2021), consultant, and partner.

I have spent most of my professional years working in complex domains and fast-paced environments, often alongside founders or team leads, and usually with ambiguous requirements.
