I'm a product designer and engineer based in sunny Norfolk, England. For the past decade, I have taken products from 0–1, as a co-founder
([GetAgent.co.uk](https://getagent.co.uk/), [Making Jam](https://www.makingjam.io), [LeadPro](https://lead.pro) – exited in 2021), consultant or partner.

My expertise spans application design and development, websites, design systems, and marketing collateral. Depending on the project, I
can take on the entire process – from design to implementation – or focus on specific areas while collaborating with existing teams.
