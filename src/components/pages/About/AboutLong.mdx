Hello, I'm Seb.

I was born in [Belgium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlwHotpl9DA). My parents moved to [Luxembourg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6r9Fif9BgjM) when I was 2, and I grew up there. I moved to the UK when I was 18 to study business at the University of Bath.

I wasn't the world's best student. I learn by doing. Most of my teenage years were spent tinkering with computers and playing point-and-click games (Day of the Tentacle is still a firm favourite, I'm currently enjoying the [remake](https://store.steampowered.com/app/388210/Day_of_the_Tentacle_Remastered/)). Outside of that, my passion was music, and spending countless hours crafting futuristic wallpapers in Photoshop and designing websites in Dreamweaver. 

I found my university course somewhat unstimulating. But it did teach me an important skill; how to research and think critically, write, present data and arguments clearly.

There, I met a close friend who introduced me to the world of entrepreneurship. Having grown up in Luxembourg – a place not exactly known for its startup culture ([yes, even opening up a bank account is a challenge](https://www.luxtimes.lu/businessandfinance/are-banking-hurdles-in-luxembourg-hindering-startup-growth/53698931.html)) – this was my first real exposure to the entrepreneurial mindset. 

I was enthralled, years of pent-up creativity finally had an outlet.

Together we started a small digital agency. Our first project involved designing and building a website for a private clinic in Brussels. During our first summer at university, we moved to Poland to try launching a Groupon-style business, teaching English on the side to pay the bills. It didn’t work out, but our agency soon began taking on more clients, primarily in the charity sector where we worked with organisations across cancer, domestic and sexual abuse, and education.

Later, we co-founded an online farmers’ market and subscription box business, [Flavrbox](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/21/christmas-gift-ideas-food-drink). Shortly after, we were accepted onto the inaugural [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) (EF) cohort. The programme required moving to London – something I could not really afford at the time – but the opportunity was too good to pass up. Despite growing the business to around 300 paying customers, I struggled to keep it afloat while working to pay rent and eventually sold the assets to join another EF startup, [Adbrain](http://www.adbrain.com/), as their Head of Design.

At Adbrain, I transitioned from web designer to UX/UI designer. I quickly became frustrated with the lack of attention to detail in how designs were implemented, which led me to learn frontend development so I could have more control over outcomes. This also made me an early advocate for designers to learn how to code. 

After three years at Adbrain, I co-founded [GetAgent.co.uk](https://getagent.co.uk/), now the UK's largest estate agent comparison site, and [JAM](https://makingjam.io/), a bootstrapped product design and management conference. At GetAgent, I worked closely with my co-founder and CTO, Pete, to develop a precursor to Tailwind called Barebones, based on the observation that existing CSS approaches weren't agile enough. GetAgent went through venture funding and accelerator programmes including Seedcamp and 500 Startups. As of today the product serves around 20,000 homesellers each month, and since 2014 has helped over 800,000 homeowners sell £145bn of property.

After helping design and build the product – which is still used to this day – I decided to step back from day-to-day operations to focus on JAM and other projects, while continuing to support from afar. 

Upon my departure, my co-founders offered a partial share buyback involving a small internal software we had built: an online valuation and lead management tool for estate agents called Proval. I scaled it up solo to around 300 paying customers, learning backend development along the way and maintaining the app entirely on my own. I eventually sold it to [Lead.pro](https://lead.pro/), where I took on the role of interim CTO and design lead, helping the company unify a suite of tools that had previously been cobbled together from different technologies. Lead.pro was ultimately sold to [nurtur.group](https://nurtur.group/) in 2021.

With JAM, we grew from a small conference hosting 200 people to 700 anually in London, 200 in Barcelona, a 50-person retreat in Wales, alongside various workshops run throughout the year. Back when Sketch was still the design tool of choice, I taught workshops on how to use that. 
Among other things, the backend skills I'd been developing over the last few years came in handy; to avoid paying the somewhat extortionate Eventbrite fees, I built a custom ticketing platform and event management app, including an attendee checkin app.

Shortly after, COVID hit. With JAM, we attempted a pivot online but ultimately had to close due to lost venue deposits and logistics challenges. 

Thankfully, I had started consulting for [Airfinity](https://www.airfinity.com/), a now life sciences analytics company. They had initially brought me in for my experience in the events space, as they were building a marketplace to connect prospective sponsors to tech event organisers. The company later pivoted to focus on medical events and achieved product-market fit by curating vaccine trial data during COVID. I designed and built the original MVP.

Next, I joined [ITD Global](https://www.itdglobal.com/), a logistics company offering freight and e-commerce delivery solutions. I led the design and development of their customer-facing booking portal – a project that had already cost over £1m and two years to build. Originally brought in to 'make it look nice,' I quickly discovered the system was fundamentally flawed – from frontend templating to database design – and proposed a full rebuild. The MVP was delivered within about six months. Alongside this, I helped design and build complex internal tools, similar to a custom version of Xero, tailored to their logistics operations.

After that, I joined [NU](https://www.thenu.com/), a healthtech company building a multiomics platform for healthcare practitioners. Originally a B2C business offering at-home test kits, personalised insights, and tailored supplements, NU pivoted to B2B in 2024. I was brought in by the CPO (formerly of Airfinity) to design and build the MVP for their new white-label platform. I served as Head of Frontend, overseeing design and development of the practitioner app while collaborating with existing backend teams. 

Since then, and in between, I've worked on shorter projects and engagments for a variety of companies, including [SilkFred](https://silkfred.com/), [Plain](https://plain.com/), [Voltage Park](https://www.voltagepark.com/), and [Yapily](https://www.yapily.com/).

During COVID, my wife and I created [Albert & Arthur](https://www.albert-arthur.com/), which began with a range of leather dog accessories and later expanded into refillable, zero-waste candles. The business allowed me to explore manufacturing, branding, and small-batch production from the ground up.

More recently, I joined [Healf](https://healf.com/). Recently named the UK's second fastest-growing company by [The Sunday Times](https://www.thetimes.com/sunday-times-100-fast-growth/company-feature/article/uk-fastest-growing-companies-2025-3svtnzj3g), my initial focus was helping the team replatform from Shopify to a headless Next.js setup, while establishing modern engineering and design practices along the way. At present, I am developing a shared design system for the web, Healf Zone, subscription portal, and mobile app.

Outside of work, I love deep research and reflection. My main interests include philosophy, history, theology, economics, and science. I enjoy cooking – especially BBQ. We have a bit of a Middle Eastern theme at home, so hummus and lamb shawarma are staples. Come round sometime, we'll make it for you.
