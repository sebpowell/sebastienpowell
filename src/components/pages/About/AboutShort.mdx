Hello, I'm Seb.

I'm a designer and engineer, based in sunny Norfolk, England.

Over the past decade, I've helped take multiple products from 0–1 – as a co-founder ([GetAgent.co.uk](https://getagent.co.uk/), [Making Jam](https://www.makingjam.io/), [LeadPro](https://lead.pro/) – exited in 2021), consultant, and partner.

I have spent most of my professional years working in complex domains and fast-paced environments, often alongside founders or team leads, and usually with ambiguous requirements. These domains have included property and estate agency, life sciences, B2B SaaS, events, eCommerce, fashion, healthtech, and logistics, among others. 

The nature of this work has led me to develop a rigorous, first-principles approach to problem-solving, along with strong lateral thinking skills and a solid understanding of how to architect systems across both design and engineering.

I'm an advocate for clean code and sound architecture.

> "The bigger lie that developers buy into is the notion that writing messy code makes them go fast in the short term, and just slows them down in the long term. Developers who accept this lie exhibit the hare’s overconfidence in their ability to switch modes from making messes to cleaning up messes sometime in the future. The fact is that making messes is always slower than staying clean, no matter which time scale you are using".
